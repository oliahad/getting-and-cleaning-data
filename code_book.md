# Variables in run_analysis.R Script File
Brief one-liners for all the variables in the Project Work, as instructed -

1. Six self-descriptive variables contain the six datasets (in text files) provided: xTrain, yTrain, xTest, yTest, subjectTrain, and subjectTest which contain data from x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train, and subject_test respectively
2. Next, we have two variables features and activities reading the files 
3. xData and yData are, respectively, the merged datasets from X_train.txt and X_test.txt files, and y_train.txt and y_test.txt files
4. mergedData has been then produced as the merged/combined dataset from both testing and training data provided-and-cleaned
5. tidyAveragesData is the final/result variable containing the output asked in the project work. Its contents have been populated in the text file: tidy_averages_data

For an overview of the given tasks and responses, please see the README file at https://github.com/oliahad/getting-and-cleaning-data/blob/master/README.md
